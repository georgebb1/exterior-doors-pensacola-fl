README

Wow, so here I am trying to create something with Ruby on Rails. Building a new application is always a challenging task, but Rails makes it easier, as there is a large community ready to help out in case things are not working. 

I installed the latest version of Rails, I use Atom to run commands, everything is new to me, but I can handle it. I also bought a new computer 3 days ago with the latest Intel i3 7100 CPU, which is a lot better compared to my previous i3 (first generation, on a 1156 Socket motherboard!).

The first project is going to be for a client who deals with [exterior doors pensacola fl](https://folkers.com/) and I'm excited to start. I'll have to take a look at the main guidelines for creating a new app, but things are looking good, can't wait to start!
